# RealisticGrowth
Realistic Growth brings a natural touch to your Minecraft world by allowing saplings, seeds, and plants to replant themselves when they despawn, just like in the real world. This plugin mimics the process where seeds or saplings fall to the ground and grow into plants or trees, provided they are placed on the correct type of soil or ground. When these items despawn, they will replant themselves if the ground beneath them is suitable for growth, just like how seeds naturally germinate in real life.

# Features:
Self-Replanting Saplings: When saplings such as Oak, Birch, Spruce, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, and Mangrove despawn, they will replant themselves on the correct ground, simulating real-world tree growth.
Configurable Planting Chance: The plugin offers full configurability, allowing you to adjust the chance (in percentage) that saplings and plants will replant themselves when they despawn. This adds a layer of realism, as not all seeds or saplings grow in the real worldâ€”sometimes they fail to take root. You can set the likelihood of regrowth to match your desired level of realism.
