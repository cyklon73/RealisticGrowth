# About
Realistic Growth brings a natural touch to your Minecraft world by allowing saplings, seeds, and plants to replant themselves when they despawn, just like in the real world. This plugin mimics the process where seeds or saplings fall to the ground and grow into plants or trees, provided they are placed on the correct type of soil or ground. When these items despawn, they will replant themselves if the ground beneath them is suitable for growth, just like how seeds naturally germinate in real life.
